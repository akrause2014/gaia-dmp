    Target:

        Notes on general refactoring that needs to be done.
        Mainly clarification of file names and functions.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    File renaming

        # Move the contents of 'aglais/bin' into 'aglais/remote/bin'
        deployments/aglais/bin
        deployments/aglais/remote/bin

        # Move the contents of 'zeppelin/bin' into 'aglais/local/bin'
        deployments/zeppelin/bin
        deployments/aglais/local/bin



# -----------------------------------------------------

    Infra ops ..
    This will be used a template for refactoring the main Ansible deployment in the future.

    Separate into 'create' and 'configure' stages.

    Even though the 'create' steps may use Ansible, they are acting on local host to create remote resources.
    Then the 'configure' steps use Ansible to deploy software into those resources.

    'create' stage has to use procedural code on localhost.
    'configure' should use declarative Ansible roles.

    Split the initial VM into two roles, 'gateway' and 'safestore'.

    'gateway' is just a ssh gateway, nothing else.
    'safestore' contains the backups of notebooks and password hashes




# -----------------------------------------------------

    DNS records

        # Refactor DNS to use local /etc/hosts
        # Get IP address and write an entry for 'zeppelin' to /etc/hosts on the client.
        # Configure local ~/.ssh/config to use the dns name 'zeppelin' rather than the IP address.
        05-config-ssh.yml => 05-config-client.yml
