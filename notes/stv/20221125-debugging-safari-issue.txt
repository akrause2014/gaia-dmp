# Issue:

https://github.com/wfau/gaia-dmp/issues/1057


"""
Iâ€™ve had reports, and noticed occasionally, that the URL https://dmp.gaia.ac.uk/ presents a blank page on first navigating to it. Sometimes pressing refresh in the browser makes the Zeppelin UI home login page appear; sometimes several presses and a short wait are necessary. Is the UI all ok and healthy?

I got Eckhard to check in Chromium/CentOS and it works first time for him, having never accessed the service before. (I use Safari on MacOS btw). Eckhard pointed out that the home page URL looks a bit funny in the navigation bar, e.g. something like
"""



# After some initial debugging this seems to be the cause:

Zeppelin redirects to an http://../api/login address (not https). This causes security errors in all browser that I've seen, but Safari time's out the request. 

For context this is the error in Chrome:

> Mixed Content: The page at 'https://dmp.gaia.ac.uk/#/?ref=%2F' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://dmp.gaia.ac.uk/api/login'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.


# Nigel has reported that the Zeppelin page be slow to load, and logout.
# This seems to be related, as Zeppelin will try to fetch content from /api/login during both login & logout



# First attempt, in conf/shiro.conf in Zeppelin change

shiro.loginUrl = /api/login
to
shiro.loginUrl = https://iris-gaia-red.gaia-dmp.uk/api/login


# Fails, causes redirect loop

# ...

# Lots of searching the web and attempts to try to understand and solve the issue with various config changes..

# ...



# Fix:
# Based on a comment found here:

https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/Knox-Zeppelin-websocket-problems/td-p/240055

# Modify the Nginx proxy config and add:

proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
proxy_read_timeout 86400;





# The following proxy config works:

upstream zeppelin {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
}


# Zeppelin Website

    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;
